the troglodytes

These are a burrowing people - they would be somewhat of a cross between Tolkien's Dwarves and Orcs.  They've been genetically engineered to be able to echo-locate. Because they often use hammers and things in their mines and underground villages, they have the ability to close their ears as natural sound protection. These people are masters of the forge and haven't lost the lore of metallurgy 

They tend to have a decent, though healthy, layer of fat and fur that is like a water dogs, with a moisture resistant outer coat and a warming inner coat, since they spend most of their time underground or foraging at night. Their foraging frequently brings them into conflict with the land species.
