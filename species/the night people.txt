The night people were originally meant to be the villains, but the more I thought about them, the more I liked them.

They are the gnomes. They are the moles. They have properties of burrowing moles with the hearing of bats. They have strong front limbs and sturdy nails on powerful fingers and use them to dig for shelters. But they will also use tools for this. 

Along with the ability to echo locate, they have very acute vision in low light. Daylight is their weakness.
