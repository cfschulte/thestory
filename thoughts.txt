The Story:
The story unfolds in pieces as I go to sleep at night. currently, we are sailing. She was taken from her home in what was then California.

The land of the dawn and evening people:

The home of the Blygain is the land of the great trees. Even when I ws alive, there were the Redwoods. Now, that the glaciers have come back, there are also varieties of Spruce and a mixture of temperat broadleaves and evergreens. At some point, someone introduced flora from what was then the Chilean Valdivian rainforest. The Blygain have nut and fruit trees and bushes and gardens that grow in clearings of their forest.
