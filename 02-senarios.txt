Scenarios:

1. Complete collapse, about 100,000 years in the future. Techno-biological hybrids have been developed with the intent of keeping humans primitive. There are many stone to early iron age societies.

We're starting out in the way future. For the most part, the world consists of "stone-age" societies. Metal tools haven't been completely lost and there are a few societies that still work with metal. Because of the destroyed cities, there are mines of very high quality steel. These were formerly the skeletons of skyscrapers, prefab buildings, and the overall backbone of what we have now.
