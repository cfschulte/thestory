The world is changing. It is now the 21st century. There have been people who consider themselves "Extropians." Once, in due time, this will happen.

Watching the tangent of technology, the next step in human evolution is not going to be purely biological. Our first step will be to use our technology as add-ons to ourselves - prostheses to not only our mechanical bodies but also to our minds. Artificial Intelligence can do amazing things, but it can't think. It is just a quick, recursive matrix operation on a lot of data.

In order to use its potential, we will find ways to connect to AI as mental helpers - crutches; better yet, stilts.

Using this, we can come to understand how to improve and build on our machines. Increase the efficiency of their Turing capability. Design them to reflect the patterns of our own minds, which after all, are just highly evolved Turing machines. At some point, someone will make complete "copy" of their minds: memories, habits, preferences, interests, and reactions.

It would be impossible to send our biological selves to the stars. We are too heavy, too fragile, too decomposable. If we want to travel through the galaxy or beyond, we will need to become our evolved selves.

This doesn't mean that we need to completely give up our biology. We could take compact samples of our DNA. Cryogenically save thousands of cells, each with a somewhat imperfect genetic copy of ourselves, but in average, an exact copy of ... us.

Because someday, we would want to visit our home. Visit and feel it the way we did in our meat-self person.

This is the story of the trip there and back.
