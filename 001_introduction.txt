The world is changing. It is now the 21st century. There have been people who consider themselves "Extropians." 

Watching the tangent of technology, the next step in human evolution is not going to be purely biological. Our first step will be to use our technology as add-ons to ourselves - prostheses to not only our mechanical bodies but also to our minds. Artificial Intelligence can do amazing things, but it can't think. It is just a quick, recursive matrix operation on a lot of data.

In order to use its potential, we will find ways to connect to AI as mental helpers - crutches; better yet, stilts.

Using this, we can come to understand how to improve and build on our machines. Increase the efficiency of their Turing capability. Design them to reflect the patterns of our own minds, which after all, are just highly evolved Turing machines. At some point, someone will make complete "copy" of their minds: memories, habits, preferences, and reactions.
